Folder Structure

PHP Folder
Each page will have its own folder.
In each folder, you will find an index.php file which serves to bring together all the other
php files in the folder as well as shared php files and use them to put together a single 
webpage. In addition, each folder will have a header.php file which will consist of meta tags
and the page title which are customized based on each page. Any file not found in a folder
are shared php files which are used across several pages.

Example: 
	About Folder:
		about.php, index.php, header.php

CSS Folder
There is no structure in this folder as there aren't many stylesheets. Bootstrap was used
to make designing webpages easier.

JavaScript Folder
There is no structure in this folder either as there aren't many JavaScript files. 
Each JavaScript file is usually named in accordance to the page it will be a part of. 
For example if the JavaScript file is meant for the product page then it might be called product.js 
and so on.

Assets Folder
This folder contains two folders including the images folder and videos folder. All the images
used are put into the images folder and all the videos used are put into the videos folder.
